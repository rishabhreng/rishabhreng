- 👋 Hi, I’m [Rishabh R](https://rishabhreng.github.io/).
- I’m interested in mathematics and I am experienced with a few programming languages: Java and Python (and at a more beginner level, C++, R, HTML/CSS, C#). I'm also on the programming team of my school's robotics team (FRC 6672, Fusion Corps) and we are world champions as of the 2022 FIRST Championship in Houston. I also play the piano and enjoy playing quiz bowl.
- 🌱 I’m currently a high school senior (12th grade).
